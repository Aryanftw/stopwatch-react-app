React Stopwatch
~ A simple and intuitive stopwatch application built using React functional components. This project demonstrates how to handle state and intervals in a React-based stopwatch, allowing users to start, stop, and reset the timer with ease.

Features
~ Start the stopwatch to begin counting seconds.
~ Stop the timer at any moment to pause the count.
~ Reset the stopwatch to set the time back to zero.
~ Efficient state management using React Hooks (useState and useRef) without the use of the useEffect hook.
~ Clean and organized code structure with clear functionality for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.

Technologies Used
~ React: For building the user interface and handling state.
~ JavaScript (ES6+): For modern syntax and logic implementation
